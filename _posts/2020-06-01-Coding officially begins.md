Hi,

Today, the Community bonding period finally ended and GSoC's three months coding period officially begins.

In the last month, I made myself more familiar with git, qml and javascript. As KDE including Gcompris has been moved to Gitlab so I also changed the configuration of my local repository accordingly and tested it. I read codes of almost all the activities (hope I didn't miss any) and I am quite comfortable with all now.

I also had unexpected online practicals last month which took the majority of my time but I am glad to share that my timeline is clean now and doesn't have any more conflicts. So, I am all ready to begin the coding period now.

I hope to have a great learning summer ahead.
